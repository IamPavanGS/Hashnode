## Welcome to My DevOps Journey

### Hello and welcome to my blog!

I'm thrilled to have you join me on this exciting journey as I dive into the world of DevOps. Whether you're a seasoned professional or just starting out like me, I hope you'll find my experiences, insights, and learnings valuable and inspiring.

### Why I Started Learning DevOps

For as long as I can remember, I've been fascinated by technology and how it can transform the way we live and work. Over the past 7 years, I’ve had the privilege of working in various IT roles, starting as a Hardware Engineer, then transitioning to a Helpdesk Engineer, a Cloud and Server Engineer, and most recently, a PowerShell Automation Engineer. Each role has provided me with valuable skills and experiences, and I’ve enjoyed every step of my journey.

I’ve come to understand the critical importance of efficient collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement in delivering high-quality software. This realization sparked my interest in the world of DevOps short for Development and Operations. It is a set of practices that bridge the gap between software development and IT operations. This particularly aim to shorten the development lifecycle, increase deployment frequency, and improve the quality and reliability of software.

I super excited to show you guys the fullest potential of DevOps to revolutionize software delivery and operations. I’m eager to learn and apply DevOps principles to make meaningful contributions to the industry.
